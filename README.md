# Etch-a-Sketch

This project implements an online version of the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. An Etch-a-Sketch is a classic mechanical drawing toy, like a sketchpad, that allows users to create drawings by manipulating two knobs to control a stylus moving across a screen filled with aluminum powder. The webpage features a 16x16 grid of square divs dynamically generated using JavaScript. Users can hover over the grid squares to draw on the canvas, leaving a pixelated trail like a pen would on paper. Additionally, the project includes three buttons at the top of the screen, allowing users to choose between three different grid styles: Classic, Progressive, or Rainbow. Each grid style offers a unique drawing experience, providing users with creative flexibility. In the "Progressive Grid", there's a progressive darkening effect where each mouse interaction adds 10% more black to the square, eventually resulting in a completely black square after ten interactions. In the "Rainbow Grid", instead of a simple color change, each interaction with the mouse randomizes the square's RGB value entirely. Each time you choose to create a new grid, a prompt at the top of the screen will ask the users to input the number of squares per side for a new grid, offering a customizable drawing space while preventing excessive resource usage.
